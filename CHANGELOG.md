### Revival Release ðŸŒ»

After a longer period of stalled development this release brings the `EthereumJS` client back
to life respectively a usable state by doing necessary dependency updates and modernizing CI.
It also comes with an updated documentation and user-facing improvements like a more reliable
and better communicated sync mechanism.

Most notable for development is the upgrade of the `ethereumjs-devp2p` dependency to `v3.0.1`.
The devp2p library is now `TypeScript` based and comes with an improved debugging experience
which will be helpful when working on further improving the sync reliability of the client and
hunting for networking bugs.

To ease jumping into the code base there is now a new structure

showing the relations between the main components as well as the initialization and message flow.
